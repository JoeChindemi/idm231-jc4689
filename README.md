--IDM 231 FINAL ZODIAC PROJECT--

This IDM 231 final project is a javascript/html/css application based upon the western zodiac system and the New York Knicks.

Users will be presented a homescreen with a title, calendar button, help section, and icons to the left and right side of the screen.

If a user enters their date of birth on the calendar, then a Knicks player, data, and sound corralating with that birthdate will be returned. Data can be re-entered.

Alternatively, a user can click on the side icon images, and the same Knicks player, data, and sound will be returned.

If a user does not know how to use the program, they can click the help section for details on how to use the program.
